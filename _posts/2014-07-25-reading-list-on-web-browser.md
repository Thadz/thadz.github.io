1. [High Performance Browser Networking: What every web developer should know about networking and web performance](http://astore.amazon.com/possiboutpos-20/detail/1449344763)

   Ilya Grigorik

   Don't have a chance to finish reading yet. Still working on it.

1. [How Browsers Work](http://ehsan.github.io/how-browsers-work/#1)

   Ehsan Akhgari

   A very concise pack of slides introducing the fundamentals of browsers.

1. [How browsers work](http://taligarsiel.com/Projects/howbrowserswork1.htm)

   Tali Garsiel

   This page provides very comprehensive and detailed gentle introduction to the architecture of browsers.

1. [The Security Architecture of the Chromium Browser](http://seclab.stanford.edu/websec/chromium/chromium-security-architecture.pdf)

   Adam Barth, Collin Jackson, Charles Reis, Google Chrome Team

   This paper presents the very primitive motivation for the architecture of Chromium broswer with security bearing in mind.

1. [Mozilla Rust And Servo](http://people.mozilla.org/~roc/Samsung/MozillaRustAndServo.pdf)

   Robert O'Callahan

   The author asks many big-picture-like questions, which are worth thinking for almost all the web application developers.

1. [Establishing Browser Security Guarantees through Formal Shim Verification](http://goto.ucsd.edu/quark/usenix12.pdf)

   Dongseok Jang, Zachary Tatlock, Sorin Lerner

   A very interesting project. They built a browser kernel inside the theorem prover and actually proved the correctness of the kernel using Coq. This broadens the range of how we think of software engineering and sheds light on building highly reliable software systems.

1. [A browser for the HTML5 era](http://breach.cc/)

   This is another very interesting and experimental project, which is written entirely in Javascript, taking advantages provided by Chromium, Node.js, and HTML/JS/CSS.
