"Web content has evolved to contain significant amounts of active code that run within the browser, making many web sites more like applications than documents. This evolution has changed the role of the browser into an operating system rather than a simple document renderer. Chromium is built like an operating system to run these applications in a safe and robust way, using multiple OS processes to isolate web sites from each other and from the browser itself. This improves robustness because each process runs in its own address space, is scheduled by the operating system, and can fail independently. Users can also view the resource usage of each process in Chromium's Task Manager."

So what would be the ideal form of a browser in the next decade?
